# Spam Email Detection using TensorFlow

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to automatically detect spam emails using TensorFlow. The goal is to ensure that the user's inbox remains clean by filtering out unwanted spam emails.

## Introduction

Spam emails pose a significant threat to email users, cluttering their inbox with unsolicited and potentially harmful content. By developing an effective spam email detection system, we can help users maintain a clean inbox and protect them from malicious attacks.

## Project Overview

- **Data Collection**: We collected a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is labeled as either spam or not spam (ham).
- **Data Preprocessing**: We preprocessed the text data to remove noise and convert it into a suitable format for model training.
- **Feature Extraction**: We extracted relevant features from the text data to feed into the machine learning model.
- **Model Building**: We built a machine learning model using TensorFlow, leveraging techniques such as neural networks for classification.
- **Model Training**: We trained the model using the preprocessed data and evaluated its performance.
